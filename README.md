# Highschool project - Theatre data base simulation
- This project was made by me and two other students from [Colegiul National Bilingv George Cosbuc](http://cosbucbilingv.ro/). 
- We have created a data storage system that makes use of files as its foundation. To represent the information from these files, we've developed several data structures.
- The program we've built runs on a console interface, presenting users with a Main Menu that grants access to various sub-menus. These sub-menus serve to modify the data stored within the files.
- Our choice of a static memory management system means that it isn't capable of adapting in real-time.
# Requirements
- This version of the project can be ran on both **Windows** and **Linux**.

# Project Status
- The project has been updated on the 11th of March 2023 (*added Linux compatibility*).
