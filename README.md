# Highschool project - Theatre data base simulation

## General Information
- This project was made by me and two other students from [Colegiul National Bilingv George Cosbuc](http://cosbucbilingv.ro/). It simulates a theatre data base using files as the data storage space. We created different data-structures which represent all the data from the files which we take as input. 
- The project was built in **CodeBlocks V20.03**.

## Requirements
- The project is recommanded to be ran on **windows** only, since there are some issues with the used C++ libraries on **Linux** and **MacOS**.

## Project Status
- The project has been completed on the 10th of January 2023.
